I find that one of the best ways to learn a new language or framework is by building a small project. Games in particular are fun to build and due to the complexity of having a lot of business logic (the game rules) and UI interactions, are typically great projects to get started. 

I had a 3 days weekend during early COVID days and decided to learn the React framework by porting one of my favorite board games - [Century Spice Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road) - to the web using React and Firebase.

I published the 20-min video on the [Fire Biscuit Gaming YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6ZK9FrN3W-7bPW9abhcHw) where I run through the process in more details giving some tips along the way. 

Let me know if you use the code for your personal projects I'd love to know what you do with it :)
